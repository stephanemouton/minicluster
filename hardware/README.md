# Hardware specifications and build

## Requirements for the cluster

* A configuration and management server with at least two Ethernet ports: one for communication inside the cluster and one for Internet access. Additional ports may enable multi kubernetes scenarios by partitioning the cluster.
* Cheap cluster nodes to be able to go up to 6 items (enough to test orchestration or inter kubernetes communication with two three-nodes sub clusters).
* Cheap but powerful enough cluster nodes in order to run real applications. 4GB of RAM and 16GB of disk is a minimum
* Everything should be fanless to be able to pack the cluster in a small space

## Selected hardware and Bill of Material

* [Bill of Material](./BoM.md) of the 1kâ‚¬ cluster

The configuration server is a cheap no-brand fanless mini PC with 4 Ethernet ports.

Cluster nodes are [Rock-PI X](https://wiki.radxa.com/RockpiX).

The rational is the following:
| Pros | Cons |
| ---- | ---- |
|eMMC storage: more reliable than microSD |New: no or small user base|
|Fanless|No Real Time Clock (RTC) by default|
|X86_64 architecture: more containers available |PXE BIOS deactivated|

Most disadvantages have a workaround and a bet on the user base is acceptable.

Nodes are powered by a professional-grade used power through a USB charger.

Network switch and server are also connected to the same power and the whole cluster is powered by a single source.

A `temperusb` USB temperature probe has been added.

## Casing

Due to space taken and risks of electric shock the "bare" version of the cluster, shown below, can't be left as-is: a casing must be found.

An old aluminium covered case, originally intended for tools storage, has been repurposed as "minicluster case". OpenBeam structure maintains all parts together.

Holes have been drilled for power and networks plugs.
